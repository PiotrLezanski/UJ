/*

Write a routine that does the following: for a given value n, create and initialize an n√ón matrix. Deduce the initialization algorithm from the following examples:

Example 1: n = 2, the matrix is:

1 2
4 3 

Example 2: n = 4, the matrix is:

 1   2   3   4
12  13  14   5
11  16  15   6
10   9   8   7

// ******************** YOUR CODE HERE ********************
// idea: to my mind, that looks like typical recursive problem. It is simmilar to some kind of DFS, but you always move along 
//         the border. One corner case is when moving up. You want to go up as far as possbile, so I added bool named up, to check
//          whether I should still go up or not. Without this, recursive call would go to the right at once (we don't want to
//          enable that).

// Worth to mention that I can make this function iterative and It would be more efficent, since recustive stack would
//    not be allocated, but it is easier to picture the problem on such recursive solution. 

// Time complexity: O(n^2)
// Space complexity: O(n^2)
